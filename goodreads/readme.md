# Exploring the Goodreads Books Dataset

The Goodreads Books Dataset provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of literature as rated and reviewed by readers around the globe. With an extensive collection of 10,000 entries, this dataset offers rich insight into several variables that contribute to the understanding of book popularity, reader engagement, and historical trends in publishing. 

## Dataset Overview

### Numerical Columns
The dataset contains several numerical columns that provide quantifiable data about each book. Below are summaries of these columns:

- **book_id**: A unique identifier for each entry. The ids range from 1 to 10,000, allowing for easy indexing.
- **goodreads_book_id**: This identifier helps in tracking books on Goodreads, with values peaking at approximately 33.3 million.
- **best_book_id**: This column correlates strongly with the Goodreads book ID, which showcases a significant relationship between these identifiers.
- **work_id**: Reflects the unique work representation on Goodreads, ranging between 87 and nearly 56 million.
- **books_count**: Indicates how many formats or editions exist for a single work, with a maximum of 3,455.
- **isbn13**: An identifier representing the ISBN of the book, the majority of which show a strong sequence pattern.
- **original_publication_year**: Shows the years when the works were originally published, with some dating back remarkably to 1750 and releases peaking in recent years.
- **average_rating**: This crucial metric reveals readers' perception, exhibiting an average score of 4.00 out of 5, indicating a generally positive reception.
- **ratings_count**: A significant indicator of popularity among readers, average ratings count stands at approximately 54,001, with a maximum of over 4.7 million.
- **work_ratings_count**: This represents the total ratings received for the work, corroborating that higher engagement often leads to more reviews and thus a vast number of ratings.
- **work_text_reviews_count**: This column indicates how many textual reviews a book has, with some works having over 155,000 textual reviews!
- **ratings_1 to ratings_5**: These categories show ratings distribution among one to five stars, revealing interesting patterns and distributions in reader preferences.

### Categorical Columns
Categorical columns offer descriptive data about the books, including:

- **isbn**: Represents the ISBN of the respective book, with a notable portion of entries missing.
- **authors**: A rich field, denoting 4,664 unique authors with Stephen King emerging as the most frequently associated name, appearing 60 times across the dataset.
- **original_title**: This captures the initial title of the work where there are variations. 
- **title**: This often designs a catchy name for market appeal, totaling 9,964 unique titles.
- **language_code**: The language in which the book is offered, with English dominating at 6,341 occurrences.
- **image_url**: Links to book images often lead to the default placeholder.
- **small_image_url**: Also contains similar data as image_url; however, it sized down for easier loading.

### Missing Values
The analysis revealed gaps in the dataset, specifically noting:
- 7% of entries lack ISBN data.
- Other noteworthy missing values include `original_publication_year` (0.21%) and `language_code` (10.84%).

### Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix highlighted the intricate relationships among various numerical columns. For instance:
- **ratings_count** and **work_ratings_count** show an almost perfect correlation, with a coefficient nearing 1, indicating that higher ratings typically lead to considerable review counts.
- Thereâ€™s a noticeable negative correlation between **books_count** and **average_rating**, presenting a complex dynamic where the number of editions might affect the overall perception of the work.

## Visualizations
Visuals play a crucial role in interpreting the data. Here are some key insights from important visualizations:
